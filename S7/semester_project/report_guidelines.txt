- careful with abbreviations (sometimes used, sometimes not), choose once and for all
- restructure Introduction and Abstract: motivations must be real motivations, abstract should talk about the initial Wikipedia articles + clear announcement of our contribution at the end of the Introduction (bullet list)
- more generally speaking, really justify our decisions ( not only "we did this, we did that")
- results should really come at the end, not necessarily at the beginning
- related works: ok but we should link it more precisely with what we are doing in the project
- tenses: choose present or past (show/showed) once and for all
- too straightforward transition from Intro to Corpora: we should better introduce or have mentionned Corpora issue earlier
- useless Appendix
- show explicitely what our work brings (results part) + analysis
- experiments -> experimental setup with more info (because the section is too short)
- give more semantic explanation of BLEU scores: we see the relative differences but are these scores good ? 
- never a section with only one subsection

For this report take care to have
        - a bullet points list at the end of the introduction with your main contributions.
        - You have 8 pages to present your work, starting with your 5 pages reports. Remind that it is no longer a project report but a scientific article. S one consistent in the writing (don’t use contractions in writing, if you introduce acronyms, use them…)
        - abstract should not contain references and should scientifically ‘sell’ your work.
        - the different sections of the article should be more or less balanced.
2. Note that we ask you to write few words about the energy consumption of your work + ethical considerations.
Theses two extra sections should appear after the 8 pages and before the Bibliography

3. In most of your bibliography there are still a lot of errors. Please take care that each entry have the authors, title, year, conference/journal…
