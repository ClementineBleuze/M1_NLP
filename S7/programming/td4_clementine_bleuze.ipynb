    "1. To **add** an element, you can use `my_list.append(elem)`. To add all the elements of some other sequence at once, you can try `my_list.extend(other_seq)`. Related to that, the addition operator `+` for lists corresponds to concatenation, and the multiplication operator `*` corresponds to duplication (remember how it went for strings?)\n",
    "1. To **remove** elements by value, you can use `my_list.remove('some_value')`, which will delete the first occurrence of that value in your list. Alternatively, you can remove elements based on their index: `del my_list[idx]` will remove the value at index `idx`; `elem = my_list.pop(idx)` will remove the value at index `idx` and place it in the variable `elem` instead.\n",
